The application will not work locally if it doesn't have a local instance of MongoDB to connect to:
We can use docker-compose up to deploy an instance of the database and an instance of the app

Another approach is to use docker desktop to create a container with this properties:
Container name: mongodb
Host port: 27017

This second approach seems to be easier and faster, so it is recommended for local deployment
